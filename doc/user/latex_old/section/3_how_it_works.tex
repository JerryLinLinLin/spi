\section{How it works}
This section describes how self-propelled instrumentation works from user's
perspective. Each subsection is a major step in the workflow.

\subsection{Building Agent}
Users build their own {\em Agent} shared library using self-propelled
instrumentation's API.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Coding. Users need to write two pieces of code: 1) payload function; 2)
  configuration code that registers payload function and does some customization
  and configuration. The configuration code must be executed right away when the
  {\em Agent} shared library is loaded into the application process, so the
  configuration code should be in the init function of the {\em Agent} shared
  library, i.e., the function with gcc directive
  \_\_attribute\_\_((constructor)).
\item Building. Users build the code into an {\em Agent} shared library linking
  with {\em libagent.so} provided by the self-propelled instrumentation
  infrastructure.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Injection}
Users run {\em Injector} in command line. They specify in command line arguments
the path of an {\em Agent} shared library and the application process to inject
to.

One trick to check whether the {\em Agent} shared library is injected
successfully is to look at memory maps file of the application process, i.e.,
/proc/PID/maps.

\subsection{Initialization} %changed configuration to initialisation as

The initialization code is executed right away when {\em Agent} shared library
is loaded into the application process.
It tells self-propelled instrumentation what are payload functions provided by
users, how would initial instrumentation be done, whether or not to enable
inter-process instrumentation propagation etc.

\subsection{Initial Instrumentation}
Once the configuration code in the {\em Agent shared library} finishes execution
inside the application process, the initial instrumentation would be performed
when certain event is triggered (e.g., after 5 seconds) or be performed right
away (e.g., instrumenting all function calls inside the {\em main} function).

\subsection{Instrumentation Propagation}
When the initial instrumentation gets executed, then instrumentation propagates
itself either within the process by following control flow, or across process
boundaries by following communication flow.

\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:intrainst} shows an example of intra-process instrumentation
propagation from step 3 to step 5.

In the example, a wrapper function {\em instrument} is invoked right before an
original function call {\em foo}.  The funciton {\em instrument} relies on the
instrumentation engine in the agent library to execute user-provided payload
function and to propagate instrumentation by instrumenting callees inside
function {\em foo}, which include {\em connect} in the example. By this point,
an invocation of {\em instrument} is inserted before {\em connect}. In this way,
instrumentation propagates from a caller to its callees.

\subsubsection{Inter-process propagation}

  \label{fig:interinst}
\end{figure}

For inter-process instrumentation propagation, the instrumentation engine
identifies communication initiation functions like {\em connect}, {\em send}, or
{\em write} and figures out the remote host.  The instrumentation engine then
contacts to the SPI daemon of the remote host on the other end of communication,
which injects the agent shared library automatically into the target process.
Then the intra-process propagation is performed inside the remote process The
workflow is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:interinst}
