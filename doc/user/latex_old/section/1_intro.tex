\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

Self-propelled instrumentation is a binary instrumentation technique that
dynamically injects a fragment of code into an application process.
The instrumentation is inserted ahead of the control flow within the process and
is propagated into other processes, following communication events, crossing
host boundaries, and collecting function-level trace data of the execution.

Self-propelled instrumentation contains two major components, {\em Agent} and
{\em Injector}.
{\em Agent} is a shared library that automatically inserts and propagates a
piece of payload code at function call events in a running process, where the
payload code contains user-defined logic, such as generating trace data to files 
for later inspection.
The instrumentation would propel itself within the process by following control
flow and across thread boundaries, process boundaries, or even host boundaries
by following communication flow.
{\em Injector} is a process that causes an application process to load the Agent
shared library, where the Injector should have at least the same privilege as
the application process.
Self-propelled instrumentation does binary instrumentation within the
application process's address space, avoiding use of the debugging interfaces
(e.g., Linux ptrace and Windows debug interface) and costly interprocess
communications.
Therefore, self-propelled instrumentation does not add significant overhead to a
process during runtime.

Self-propelled instrumentation can be used in many applications that require low
overhead instrumentation and full automation of instrumentation propagation
following control flow.
For example, we have used self-propelled instrumentation for problem diagnosis
in distributed systems~\cite{Mirgorodskiy2006} and for automated diagram
construction for complex software systems in security analysis~\cite{Fang2012}.
