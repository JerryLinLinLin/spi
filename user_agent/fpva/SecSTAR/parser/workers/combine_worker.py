    Description:

      1. If $pid.xml not exist, move the first $pid-$seq.xml to $pid.xml.
      2. If $pid.xml exists, insert things in between <traces></traces> of other
      $pid-$seq.xmls into $pid.xml.
      3. If any trace file doesn't contain '-', then we assume all trace files
      are combined, we return immediately.
